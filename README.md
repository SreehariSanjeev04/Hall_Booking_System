# Hall Booking System

## Overview

The Hall Booking System is a web application that allows users to book halls for events. It includes features such as user login, role-based access control (admin and user roles), viewing bookings, managing booking requests, and analyzing booking data.

This project utilizes React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Role-based access control using JWT authentication for secure login and session management.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays user-specific data, including bookings and booking requests.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admin users can view all booking requests, and analytics about booking trends.
- **Booking Management**: Users can make booking requests, and admins can approve or reject requests.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Admins can view trends in booking data over time, with visual representation using charts.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For handling routing and navigation.
- **Chart.js**: For rendering booking trends with charts.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the backend API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and booking data.

### Authentication
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and session management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- MongoDB instance running locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SreehariSanjeev04/Hall_Booking_System
cd Hall_Booking_System
npm install
npm start
```
# Features
## User Authentication
Login: Users can log in with a username, password, and roll number.
Role-based Access Control: Users are assigned different roles (e.g., user, admin). Only admins can view all booking requests and analytics.
## Admin Dashboard
Analytics: Admins can view trends over time for bookings using a Line chart generated by Chart.js.
Manage Requests: Admins can approve or reject booking requests.
User Management: Admins can manage users and their roles.

## User Dashboard
Booking Overview: Users can view their booking requests and see the status (approved, pending, rejected).
Request New Booking: Users can submit new booking requests which will be approved by an admin.

# Thought Process 
    
Idea was to create a minimal viable product within the given deadline that is satisfactory reliable. Backend design took around 2 days, setting up endpoints and managing the authentication, with lots of trial and error checks. Frontend design and integration took most of the time (4-5 days), to create components and apply specific styles to each, while ensuring Role Based Access Control. 
    
1) JSONWebtoken is used to protect the api endpoints, securing essential data such as user id and role to make sure that authorized person has access to the endpoint.

2) The token is stored in localstorage and with the help of UserContext (fetches the token, manipulates it to check the expiration time and user role), client side access control is implemented.

3) Used Tailwind CSS instead of Vanilla CSS for better productivity and faster development.

3) Minimizing database reads and writes was one of the goals, due to which I have implemented batch requests in admin panel so that confirmation and rejection of bookings are done in a single request rather than multiple requests for each decision, minimizing database loads. Initially thought of using caching to for faster data fetch, but there can be an issue with data consistency. 

## Future Improvements
        
1) Better UI, with animations and light/dark mode.
2) Caching of data for faster performance.
3) Better error checking mechanism
4) 2FA authentication for better security
5) Forgot password mechanism

# Challenges

Multiple challenges were faced while developing the website such as minimizing reads and writes to the database to make it cost effective and implementing the access control system which juggling issues with state management. Design could have been improved with light/dark mode but functionality is the main goal. 

Note - The project is hosted on render, due to which the web service shuts down periodically due to inactivity. Requests may take upto 50s in such scenarios to start up the service, hence users are requested to reload to use the service.
